HAI 1.2
CAN HAS STDIO?
    OBTW
       Essentially, the final grade for my chemistry class was supposed to be 
       2/9 * each quarter grade + 1/9 * the final exam. With the final exam removed,
       this (nonsensical) script calculates the value that the fourth quarter needs to 
       be (after the final exam has been administered) to allow the actual final grade
       to be the same with each quarter being a quarter of the final grade.
    TLDR
