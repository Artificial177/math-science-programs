# My Intentions With These Solutions

This is a compilation of my solutions to the problems over on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).
They're not intended to be in any specific language, they're simply just in the language I chose to do them in at the time. That being said, I may come back and redo some of the programs in other languages as either a learning exercise or simply out of interest.

If you're struggling on a problem and you're looking for a solution, **please don't look at these**. There's plenty of non-solution help out there which will help you get to the answer. This is intended for fellow members who are looking for ways other people have solved the problems.
