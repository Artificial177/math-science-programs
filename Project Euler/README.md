# My Intentions With These Solutions

This is a compilation of my solutions to the problems over on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

If you're struggling on a problem and you're looking for a solution, **please don't look at these**. There's plenty of non-solution help out there which will help you get to the answer. This is intended for fellow members who are looking for ways other people have solved the problems. 

## Languages

I primarily solve problems in either Python or C++, either depending on which is convenient at the time, or simply which one I *want* to solve it in. 

However, I don't simply restrict it to these two, you'll probably notice some solved in other languages, and this is simply either in an attempt to practice the language, as with the ones solved in F#, which I did as an introduction to functional programming, or whether it has a specific library that I wanted to use to solve it, like Problem 97 solved in Java, for the BigInteger library.
